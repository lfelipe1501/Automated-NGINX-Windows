# Installation Guide

1. You can clone this repository and copy the .BAT files into the nginx binary folder you have installed on your computer.:

- ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/lfelipe1501/Automated-NGINX-Windows.git
  ```

2. To install and use the services for nginx and php-cgi you need to follow the following steps:

- Make sure you have the correct path of your php and nginx services inside the windows variables, you can also use these commands to add them by adjusting the paths of the binaries on your computer:

### Remember to run the PowerShell in Administrator mode
![CMD-Windows-Admin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lfelipe1501/lfelipe-projects/master/nginx-windows/cmdasadmin.png)

Run the following commands:
```pwsh

# Set user VARIABLES
setx PHP_HOME "D:\serverlocal\php"
setx NGINX_HOME "D:\serverlocal\nginx"

# Set System Global VARIABLES
setx -m PHP_HOME "D:\serverlocal\php"
setx -m NGINX_HOME "D:\serverlocal\nginx"

# Set user PATH VARIABLES
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("path", $env:path + ";%PHP_HOME%;%NGINX_HOME%", "User")

# Set System Global PATH VARIABLES
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("path", $env:path + ";%PHP_HOME%;%NGINX_HOME%", "Machine")

```
